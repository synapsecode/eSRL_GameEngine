HOW_TO_PLAY:
**Game Title:** Hypotenuse Snap!

**Objective of the Game:**
- Your goal is to prove the Pythagorean theorem visually by snapping a moving yellow square along the hypotenuse of a right triangle so that its area matches the combined areas of the blue and green leg squares.

---

**Controls and Interactions:**
- **TAP (Left Mouse Click or Space Bar):**
  - Instantly "snaps" the yellow hypotenuse square to its current location along the hypotenuse.
- **HOLD (Hold Mouse Button or Space Bar):**
  - Moves the yellow square steadily forward along the hypotenuse.
- **RELEASE (Let go of Mouse Button or Space Bar) [after holding]:**
  - The square automatically slows and snaps to the nearest grid point for easier alignment.
- **Restart After Failure:**
  - Click anywhere to restart when the triangle deconstructs after a failed attempt.

**Quick Reference:**
- Use mouse or Space Bar for all actions.
  - Hold to move, tap/release to snap.

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Visual Layout:**
   - Each level starts with a right triangle in the center of a grid-background.
   - The triangle’s **base (bottom side)** is blue, **altitude (vertical side)** is green, **hypotenuse (diagonal side)** is yellow.
   - A blue square overlays the base; a green square overlays the altitude.
   - The hypotenuse has a moving yellow square that you control. A faint, outlined version marks the "perfect" position.

2. **Moving the Hypotenuse Square:**
   - When the level begins, the yellow square starts at the hypotenuse's bottom vertex.
   - **Hold/tap** to move the square forward; it animates at a set speed (faster each level).
   - As you snap, the square’s color transitions from yellow to cyan, indicating a closer area match.
   - You must stop (snap) the square at the exact area match (when square area on hypotenuse equals combined areas of leg squares).

3. **Snapping Precision:**
   - Upon release or tap, the game checks if the area of the hypotenuse square matches the sum of the blue and green squares within a small margin of error.
   - The closer your timing, the more precise the snap.
   - Snapping quickly after a level starts grants a “speed bonus”—special purple flash.

4. **Feedback:**
   - **Success:** Triangle edges and both leg squares pulse green; hypotenuse square turns cyan; right-angle cyan dot glows. Next triangle appears after a moment.
   - **Failure:** Triangle flashes red and quickly breaks apart; a "snap" sound plays. You must click to restart.

5. **Progression:**
   - Each successful snap increases the level, speeds up the hypotenuse square's movement, and introduces new triangle shapes with varied side lengths, requiring greater precision.

6. **Game Over:**
   - If you snap with incorrect area alignment, instant failure occurs (triangle and square flash red, triangle deconstructs).
   - Click to restart from level 1.

**Win/Loss Conditions:**

- **Win (Level Up):**
  - Snap the hypotenuse square so its area matches the sum of the blue and green squares (leg squares) within allowed precision.
  - Receive color and sound feedback, and proceed to a new triangle at a higher speed.

- **Loss (Game Over):**
  - Snap at the wrong spot (areas not matched—too early/late).
  - Triangle flashes red, breaks down; game prompts to restart.

**Special Features & Tips:**

- **Speed Bonus:** Snap very quickly (within ~600ms of the level start) for a purple flash and extra feedback.
- **Color Cues:** Watch for the yellow-to-cyan transition and pulsing green squares/edges for success.
- **Grid Assistance:** Upon release from a hold, the square slows and snaps to grid for easier alignment—use this to your advantage.
- **Glowing Dot:** The cyan dot at the right angle glows on a successful snap; it's a visual indicator of mastery.
- **Difficulty Ramps:** Every success increases the movement speed and triangle sizes—don’t rush unless you’re sure!
- **Educational Note:** Every successful snap visually "proves" the Pythagorean theorem—you're matching the sum of the areas (a² + b² = c²) with your timing.

**Summary Steps:**
1. At each level, observe the triangle and the squares.
2. Hold mouse or Space Bar to move the hypotenuse square forward.
3. Release or tap to snap to your chosen spot.
4. Try to align so the hypotenuse square’s area matches the combined areas of the blue and green squares.
5. Watch the color and animation feedback to confirm your match.
6. Level up after success; restart after failure.

Enjoy visualizing and mastering the Pythagorean theorem!

**If you’re new:** Start slow, watch the color changes, and rely on the grid snap for precise alignment!

---

**Win:** Correct snap = level up, faster triangles, increased challenge!
**Lose:** Incorrect snap = triangle collapse, click to restart.

---

**Controls Recap:**
- Mouse Click / Space: Tap to snap instantly; Hold to move; Release slows and grid-snaps the square.

Good luck snapping the perfect hypotenuse!
