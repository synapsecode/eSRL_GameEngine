## GAME FLOW

**Game Over Condition:** [Single, clear condition - collision with hazard, falling off screen, etc.]

**Visual Feedback for Failure:** [Explosion, flash, sound effect description]

**Success Indicator:** [How players know they're doing well]

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES CHECKLIST

✓ **Novel yet Intuitive:** [How the game presents the concept in a fresh way]
✓ **Clear Failure State:** [Why the game over condition is immediately obvious]
✓ **Simple Visuals:** [How geometric shapes and color create clarity]
✓ **Implicit Feedback:** [How players learn through visual cues alone]
✓ **Action-based Rewards:** [How skill is directly rewarded]
✓ **Monotony Resistance:** [Why simple button mashing won't work]

---

## EDUCATIONAL VALUE

**Concept Reinforcement:** [How gameplay reinforces the educational concept]

**Skill Development:** [What cognitive or motor skills players develop]

**Difficulty Scaling:** [How the game adapts to demonstrate advanced aspects of the concept]

---

## CONSTRAINTS OBSERVED

- ✗ No power-ups
- ✗ No rhythm mechanics
- ✗ No mazes
- ✗ No energy/fuel/time limits
- ✗ No balance mechanics
- ✗ No complex scoring systems
- ✗ Maximum 3 object types
- ✓ Simple geometric shapes only
- ✓ Limited color palette (7 colors)
- ✓ Self-explanatory mechanics

---

**IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
1. Keep it simple - focus on ONE core mechanic that deeply represents the educational concept
2. Make failure obvious and immediate
3. Use visual feedback instead of UI elements
4. Design for progressive mastery, not complexity
5. Ensure the game teaches through play, not explicit instruction
6. Avoid any mechanics from the AVOID list
7. Maximum 3 object types per game
8. All colors must be from the allowed palette


Just return what is asked and nothing. else , no checklists etc
