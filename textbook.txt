Pythagoras Theorem Game

The Pythagoras theorem which is also referred to as the Pythagorean theorem explains the relationship between the three sides of a right-angled triangle. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides of a triangle. Let us learn more about the Pythagoras theorem, the Pythagoras theorem formula, and the proof of Pythagoras theorem along with examples.
The Pythagoras theorem states that if a triangle is a right-angled triangle, then the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Observe the following triangle ABC, in which we have BC2 = AB2 + AC2​​. Here, ​​​​AB is the base, AC is the altitude (height), and BC is the hypotenuse. It is to be noted that the hypotenuse is the longest side of a right-angled triangle.
The Pythagoras theorem equation is expressed as, c2 = a2 + b2, where 'c' = hypotenuse of the right triangle and 'a' and 'b' are the other two legs. Hence, any triangle with one angle equal to 90 degrees produces a Pythagoras triangle and the Pythagoras equation can be applied in the triangle.
Pythagoras theorem was introduced by the Greek Mathematician Pythagoras of Samos. He was an ancient Greek philosopher who formed a group of mathematicians who worked religiously on numbers and lived like monks. Although Pythagoras introduced the theorem, there is evidence that proves that it existed in other civilizations too, 1000 years before Pythagoras was born. The oldest known evidence is seen between the 20th to the 16th century B.C in the Old Babylonian Period.
he Pythagorean theorem formula states that in a right triangle ABC, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two legs. If AB and AC are the sides and BC is the hypotenuse of the triangle, then: BC2 = AB2 + AC2​. In this case, AB is the base, AC is the altitude or the height, and BC is the hypotenuse.

Another way to understand the Pythagorean theorem formula is using the following figure which shows that the area of the square formed by the longest side of the right triangle (the hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the area of the squares formed by the other two sides of the right triangle.
